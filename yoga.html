                <h3> What is yoga and how does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yoga is an ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian philosophy. It began as a spiritual practice but has become
                    popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although classical yoga also includes other elements, yoga as practiced in the United States typically emphasizes
                    physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation (dyana).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different yoga styles, ranging from gentle practices to physically demanding ones. Differences in the types
                    of yoga used in research studies may affect study results. This makes it challenging to evaluate research on the health effects of yoga.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yoga and two practices of Chinese origin—tai chi and qi gong—are sometimes called “meditative movement” practices.
                    All three practices include both meditative elements and physical ones.
