                <h3>How we started</h3>
                <p>
                    We started in August 2010 organizing outdoor mass-yoga events. As people were interested in attending events
                    regularly and loved the teachers, we opened our wellness studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We organize private weekend retreats in remote locations, at a place with no internet or mobile reception.
                    It helps people to forget about their everyday problems and have a rest from their busy life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our customers can download video lessons or attend classes in the studio.
                    We provide private lessons for individuals and groups. We organise team-building events.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-col">
                <p>
                    Our Body-Mind center don't have mirrors. This is so people can focus their awareness inward rather than how a pose
                    — or the people around them — looks. Surveys have found that those who practiced yoga were more aware of their bodies
                    than people who didn't practice yoga. They were also more satisfied with and less critical of their bodies.
                </p>
                <p>People who practice yoga and are mindful eaters are more in tune with their bodies. They may be more sensitive to hunger cues and feelings of fullness.</p>
                <p>We promote helathy lifestyle and looking after the body and spiritual health.</p>
